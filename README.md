* JarusTest.API is the Web API project - all the functionality has been completed
  * Browse https://localhost:44325/api/quotes for Quotes page. This page returns the available list of quotes. Today morning, I have got the mail confirming that there will be only one quote. But, I have not modified the functionality. Of course, it is just a matter of removing the extra declared quotes.
  * Browse https://localhost:44325/api/people for the People page.
  * Browse https://localhost:44325/api/additionalinsureds for additional insureds page. This page maps both quote and person and shows the JSON result.
* JarusTest-UI is the User Interface Project - still working on this project
  * This program cannot be used to run and test the assigned functionality.
